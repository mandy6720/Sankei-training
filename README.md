Here are some following tickets you should be able to pick up now that you are a master of content sources, chains, and features!

# TICKET - 01

## User story
As a user, I would like to add a new chain to display my features in a more interesting way.

## Description
Create a new chain called `double-chain`. This chain should split all of its children into two columns. The user should be able to configure if the column style is `wide-left`, `wide-right`, or `even`. The user should also be able to decide the number of features that should exist in the left column. This field should be required for display.

## Acceptance Criteria
- There should be a chain called `double-chain`
- The chain should split it's children into two columns.
- The user should be able to select 3 different display options (wide left, wide right, or even) from a dropdown.
- The user must decide on the number of features to display in the first column of the chain.



# TICKET - 02

## User story
As a user, I would like to be able to fetch content from site service to use in my feature pack.

## Description
Create a new content source called `site-menu`. This content source should fetch content from the `/site/v3/navigation/demo/?hierarchy=<hierarchy-name>&_id=$<section-id>` where hierarchy and id are optional parameters. After you see this content coming back in the debugger, you can use that to make a schema!

## Acceptance Criteria
- There should be a content source that fetches from the site service endpoint
- The content source should take in a `hierarchy` and `id` parameter
- The hierarchy param should use `default` as a default if it is undefined
- The id param should use `/` as a default if it is undefined
- The content source should be usable in the debugger of the PageBuilder dev tools

## Example Hierarchies from Demo
- `footer`
- `main-site-navigation`

## Example Sections from Demo
- `/food`
- `/news/arts-and-entertainment`
- `/news`



# TICKET - 03

## User story
As a user, I would like to create a navigation bar that uses content from site service.

## Description
Create a new `global` feature called `nav bar`. This feature should allow the PageBuilder user to configure the content source so that it takes in the new `site menu` content source. This featurer should then display the links from site service hierarchy.

## Example Hierarchies from Demo
- `footer`
- `main-site-navigation`

## Acceptance Criteria
- There should be a feature named `nav bar` in the global group.
- The feature should display a list of links from any site service hierarchy.
